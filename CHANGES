Revision history for Perl extension Manage::Module::Changes.

2.05  Fri Nov 16 15:16:00 2012
	- Allow for version #s which start with 'v'.

2.04  Mon Mar 26 11:31:00 2012
	- Stop uninit warning when a line being tested for a datetime contains just 1 field.
	- Output a '-' as documented, rather than a '.', at the start of any line which happens to start with
		Config::IniFiles' reserved token EOT.
	- Add META.json to MANIFEST.

2.03  Wed Feb 23 17:21:00 2011
	- Add missing dependency Hash::FieldHash to Build.PL and Makefile.PL. Re-generate metatdata files.

2.02  Tue Feb 22  9:07:00 2011
	- Add missing dependency Perl6::Slurp to Build.PL and Makefile.PL. Re-generate metatdata files.

2.01  Mon Feb 21 18:30:00 2011
	- Allow for a line in CHANGES to contain just 1 long token, without outputting a warning under recent Perls.

2.00  Tue Feb 15 14:59:00 2011
	- Rewrite to allow client access to the memory-based version of Changelog.ini.
	- Add scripts/report.names.pl to demonstrate this feature.
	- new() now takes a hash, not a hashref, since I've adopted the fabulous Hash::FieldHash.
	- Replace eval{} with Try::Tiny.
	- Only remove commas from lines which match /^\d/, since the digit(s) are assumed to be a version #,
	  and hence the commas are assumed to be embedded in dates.
	- Discontinue convert() and convert_body(), which were available in V 1.
	- What used to be convert() is now writer(reader() ).
	- What used to be convert_body() is now transform().
	- The default input file (under -c) is CHANGES, not ./CHANGES.
	- The default input file (without -c) is Changelog.ini, not ./Changelog.ini.
	- Add warnings to docs that config(), get_latest_release() and get_latest_version() must be called after read().
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Replace Carp::croak with die.
	- Use real version numbers instead of 0 in the required modules lists in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

1.08  Sun Feb 21 12:56:13 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.07  Wed Feb 10 13:53:00 2010
	- Add META.yml. Update MANIFEST.SKIP. Add MANIFEST and MYMETA.yml.

1.06  Thu Nov 12 10:19:00 2009
	  - Run dos2unix on all files.

1.05  Thu Jul  8 10:08:00 2009
	  - Rename t/Changes to t/Non.standard.name because under MS Windows there is no difference
	  	between the name t/Changes and the other test file t/CHANGES
	  - Patch t/02.convert.t to match
	  - Use File::HomeDir rather than relying on $ENV{'HOME'}

1.04  Wed Feb 18 11:46:00 2009
	  - Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
	  - Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
	  - Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names, because '_' is a shift char)

1.03  Tue Jul 22 14:41:00 2008
	  - Rename CHANGES to Changes.txt to match my other modules

1.02  Wed Jul 16 17:14:00 2008
