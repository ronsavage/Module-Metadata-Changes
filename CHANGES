Revision history for Perl extension Manage::Module::Changes.

1.04  Wed Feb 18 11:46:00 2009
	  - Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
	  - Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
	  - Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names, because '_' is a shift char)

1.03  Tue Jul 22 14:41:00 2008
	  - Rename CHANGES to Changes.txt to match my other modules

1.02  Wed Jul 16 17:14:00 2008
