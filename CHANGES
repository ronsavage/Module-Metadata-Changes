1.09  Tue Fev 15 14:59:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.

1.08  Sun Feb 21 12:56:13 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

1.07  Wed Feb 10 13:53:00 2010
	- Add META.yml. Update MANIFEST.SKIP. Add MANIFEST and MYMETA.yml.

1.06  Thu Nov 12 10:19:00 2009
	  - Run dos2unix on all files.

1.05  Thu Jul  8 10:08:00 2009
	  - Rename t/Changes to t/Non.standard.name because under MS Windows there is no difference
	  	between the name t/Changes and the other test file t/CHANGES
	  - Patch t/02.convert.t to match
	  - Use File::HomeDir rather than relying on $ENV{'HOME'}

1.04  Wed Feb 18 11:46:00 2009
	  - Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
	  - Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
	  - Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names, because '_' is a shift char)

1.03  Tue Jul 22 14:41:00 2008
	  - Rename CHANGES to Changes.txt to match my other modules

1.02  Wed Jul 16 17:14:00 2008

	  	has reported a failed test with an earlier version
