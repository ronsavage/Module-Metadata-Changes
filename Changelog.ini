Comments= <<EOT
- Rename t/Changes to t/Non.standard.name because under MS Windows there is no difference
between the name t/Changes and the other test file t/CHANGES
- Patch t/02.convert.t to match
- Use File::HomeDir rather than relying on $ENV{'HOME'}

Comments= <<EOT
- Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
- Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names because '_' is a shift char)
