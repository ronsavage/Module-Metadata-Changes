[V 2.00]
Date=2011-02-15T14:59:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Rewrite to allow client access to the memory-based version of Changelog.ini.
- Add scripts/report.names.pl to demonstrate this feature.
- new() now takes a hash, not a hashref, since I've adopted the fabulous Hash::FieldHash.
- Replace eval{} with Try::Tiny.
- Only remove commas from lines which match /^\d/, since the digit(s) are assumed to be a version #,
and hence the commas are assumed to be embedded in dates.
- Discontinue convert() and convert_body(), which were available in V 1.
- What used to be convert() is now writer(reader() ).
- What used to be convert_body() is now transform().
- The default input file (under -c) is CHANGES, not ./CHANGES.
- The default input file (without -c) is Changelog.ini, not ./Changelog.ini.
- Add warnings to docs that config(), get_latest_release() and get_latest_version() must be called after read().
- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
- Replace Carp::croak with die.
- Use real version numbers instead of 0 in the required modules lists in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

[V 1.05]
Date=2009-07-08T10:08:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Rename t/Changes to t/Non.standard.name because under MS Windows there is no difference
between the name t/Changes and the other test file t/CHANGES
- Patch t/02.convert.t to match
- Use File::HomeDir rather than relying on $ENV{'HOME'}

[V 1.04]
Date=2009-02-18T11:46:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Output 'Changelog.*' rather than 'Configlog.*' in the [Module] section of Changelog.ini
- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES because search.cpan.org won't display Changes.txt
- Rename t/*_*.t to t/*.*.t (since I prefer '.' to '_' in file names, because '_' is a shift char)
